                 Network infrastructure Hiding Protocol

Abstract

   The Network infrastructure Hiding Protocol (NHP) is a cryptography-
   based session-layer protocol designed to implement Zero Trust
   principles by rendering protected network resources invisible to
   unauthorized entities.  By requiring authentication before connection
   and operating at OSI layers 5 , NHP conceals IP addresses, ports, and
   domains from exposure to reconnaissance and automated exploitation,
   effectively reducing the attack surface.  This draft defines the
   architecture, message format, and workflow of the NHP protocol,
   outlines its security objectives, and provides guidance for
   integration into modern network infrastructures and Zero Trust
   deployments.

1.  Introduction

   Since its inception in the 1970s, the TCP/IP networking model has
   prioritized openness and interoperability, laying the foundation for
   the modern Internet.  However, this design philosophy also exposes
   systems to reconnaissance and attack.

   Today, the cyber threat landscape has been dramatically reshaped by
   the rise of AI-driven attacks, which bring unprecedented speed and
   scale to vulnerability discovery and exploitation.  Automated tools
   continuously scan the global network space, identifying weaknesses in
   real-time.  As a result, the Internet is evolving into a "Dark
   Forest," where *visibility equates to vulnerability*. In such an
   environment, any exposed service becomes an immediate target.

   The Zero Trust model, which mandates continuous verification and
   eliminates implicit trust, has emerged as a modern approach to
   cybersecurity.  Within this context, the Network infrastructure
   Hiding Protocol (NHP) offers a new architectural element:
   authenticated-before-connect access at the session layer.  Inspired
   by Single-Packet Authorization (SPA) and Software Defined Perimeter
   (SDP) technologies, NHP advances the concept further by using
   cryptographic protocols (e.g., Noise, ECC) to obfuscate
   infrastructure and enforce granular access control.

   This document outlines the motivations behind NHP, its design
   objectives, message structures, integration options, and security
   considerations for adoption within Zero Trust frameworks.

3.  Security Considerations

   NHP is explicitly designed to prevent unauthorized discovery of
   network resources.  It implements multiple layers of cryptographic
   protection and enforces access controls before any TCP or TLS
   handshake occurs.  As a result:

   *  The risk of port scanning and IP enumeration is significantly
      reduced.

   *  Mutual authentication is performed at the session layer using
      asymmetric cryptography.

   *  NHP packet headers are designed to be indistinguishable from
      random noise to unauthenticated entities.

   Potential threats include cryptographic downgrade attacks, traffic
   analysis, or exploitation of weak authentication mechanisms.
   Therefore, implementations must:

   *  Use strong ECC keys (e.g., Curve25519) and modern AEAD ciphers.

   *  Implement replay protection and rate limiting.

   *  Follow best practices for key management and endpoint hardening.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
