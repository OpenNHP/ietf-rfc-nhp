# IETF Internet-Draft: Network infrastructure Hiding Protocol (NHP)

This repository hosts the working draft and associated materials for the proposed IETF Internet-Draft:

> **Network infrastructure Hiding Protocol (NHP)**  
> Draft name: `draft-ietf-secdispatch-nhp.md`  
> Category: `Informational`  
> Submission Type: `IETF`  
> Area: `SEC`  
> Working Group: `SECDispatch`  

## Overview

The **Network infrastructure Hiding Protocol (NHP)** is a cryptography-driven, session-layer protocol designed to implement Zero Trust principles by **hiding network infrastructure** from unauthorized actors. NHP prevents exposure of IP addresses, ports, and domains until authentication is complete ‚Äî enforcing an "authenticate-before-connect" model at OSI layers 5‚Äì6.

NHP is especially relevant in the era of **AI-driven cyber threats**, where automated tools can scan, identify, and exploit vulnerabilities at machine speed. In this ‚ÄúDark Forest‚Äù landscape, **visibility equates to vulnerability** ‚Äî NHP turns that visibility off by default.

## Key Concepts

- **Session-layer protocol**: operates at OSI layers 5‚Äì6.
- **Mutual authentication** before TCP/TLS handshakes.
- **Noise Protocol Framework** and **Curve25519 ECC**.
- **Defense by invisibility**: unauthorized users see nothing.
- **Designed for Zero Trust** and integrates with SDP, FIDO, and DNS.
