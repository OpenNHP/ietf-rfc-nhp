                 Network-Infrastructure Hiding Protocol

Abstract

   The Network-Infrastructure Hiding Protocol (NHP) is a cryptography-
   based session-layer protocol designed to operationalize Zero Trust
   principles by concealing protected network resources from
   unauthorized entities.  NHP enforces authentication-before-connect
   access control, rendering IP addresses, ports, and domain names
   invisible to unauthorized users.  This document defines the protocol
   architecture, cryptographic framework, message formats, and workflow
   to enable independent implementation of NHP.  It represents the third
   generation of network hiding technology—evolving from first-
   generation port knocking to second-generation Single-Packet
   Authorization (SPA) and now to NHP with advanced asymmetric
   cryptography, mutual authentication, and scalability for modern
   threats.  This specification also provides guidance for integration
   with Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP), DNS, FIDO, and Zero Trust
   policy engines.

1.  Introduction

   Since its inception in the 1970s, the TCP/IP networking model has
   prioritized openness and interoperability, laying the foundation for
   the modern Internet.  However, this design philosophy also exposes
   systems to reconnaissance and attack.  As Vint Cerf, who personally
   designed many of these components, stated, "We didn't focus on how
   you could wreck this system intentionally."

   Today, the cyber threat landscape has been dramatically reshaped by
   the rise of AI-driven attacks, which bring unprecedented speed and
   scale to vulnerability discovery and exploitation.  Automated tools
   continuously scan the global network space, identifying weaknesses in
   real-time.  Large Language Models (LLMs) can now autonomously exploit
   one-day vulnerabilities, and AI systems can generate working exploits
   for published CVEs in minutes.  As a result, the Internet is evolving
   into a "Dark Forest," where *visibility equates to vulnerability*. In
   such an environment, any exposed service becomes an immediate target.

   The Zero Trust model, which mandates continuous verification and
   eliminates implicit trust, has emerged as a modern approach to
   cybersecurity.  Within this context, the Network-Infrastructure
   Hiding Protocol (NHP) offers a new architectural element:
   authenticated-before-connect access at the session layer.

   NHP builds upon foundational work in the Cloud Security Alliance's
   Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP) and Single-Packet Authorization
   (SPA) frameworks, representing the third generation of network hiding
   technology:

   *  *First Generation - Port Knocking:* Simple port sequences
      vulnerable to interception and replay attacks.

   *  *Second Generation - SPA:* Encrypted single-packet authorization
      with improved security but limited scalability.

   *  *Third Generation - NHP:* Advanced asymmetric cryptography, mutual
      authentication, Noise Protocol-based key exchange, and enterprise-
      grade scalability.

   This document outlines the motivations behind NHP, its design
   objectives, message structures, integration options, and security
   considerations for adoption within Zero Trust frameworks.

3.  Design Objectives

   The NHP protocol is designed to achieve the following objectives:

   1.  *Infrastructure Invisibility:* Eliminate unauthorized network
       visibility by enforcing authentication prior to session
       establishment.  Protected resources remain invisible to
       unauthorized scanners and attackers.

   2.  *Session Layer Operation:* Operate at OSI Layer 5, complementing
       existing TCP, UDP, and QUIC transports without requiring changes
       to underlying network infrastructure.

   3.  *Decentralized Trust:* Support decentralized trust using
       asymmetric cryptography and ephemeral key exchange, eliminating
       single points of trust failure.

   4.  *Fine-Grained Access Control:* Enable context-based policy
       enforcement across heterogeneous environments, supporting least-
       privilege access.

   5.  *Integration Capability:* Integrate with existing Zero Trust
       controllers, SDP gateways, identity systems (IAM), DNS
       infrastructure, and FIDO authentication.

   6.  *Scalability:* Support enterprise-scale deployments with
       clustered servers, distributed access controllers, and multi-
       tenant isolation.

   7.  *AI Threat Mitigation:* Reduce the attack surface against AI-
       driven reconnaissance and exploitation by denying visibility
       before authentication.

4.  Threat Model

   NHP is designed to mitigate the following threat categories:

4.1.  Reconnaissance and Scanning

   Automated scanning tools and AI-driven reconnaissance continuously
   probe Internet-facing services.  NHP eliminates the ability to
   discover protected resources by requiring cryptographic
   authentication before any network visibility is granted.

4.2.  Pre-Authentication Exploits

   Many vulnerabilities can be exploited before authentication occurs.
   By enforcing authentication-before-connect, NHP prevents attackers
   from reaching vulnerable services.

4.3.  DDoS Attacks

   NHP reduces DDoS attack surface by hiding service endpoints.
   Attackers cannot target what they cannot discover.

4.4.  Credential Theft and Replay

   NHP uses ephemeral keys and timestamp-based nonces to prevent
   credential replay attacks.  Each session requires fresh cryptographic
   material.

4.5.  Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

   Mutual authentication using asymmetric cryptography ensures both
   parties verify each other's identity before establishing
   communication.

5.  Architectural Overview

   NHP operates as a distributed session-layer protocol that enforces
   authentication-before-connect access between clients and protected
   resources.

5.1.  Core Components

5.1.1.  NHP-Agent

   The NHP-Agent is a client-side process, SDK, or embedded module that
   initiates communication with the protected network.  Its
   responsibilities include:

   *  Generating and sending NHP-KNK (Knock) messages to the NHP-Server

   *  Performing cryptographic key exchange using Noise Protocol
      handshakes

   *  Managing client identity credentials and device attestation

   *  Handling session lifecycle including keepalives and re-
      authentication

5.1.2.  NHP-Server

   The NHP-Server is the core control-plane service responsible for:

   *  Receiving and validating NHP-KNK messages from NHP-Agents

   *  Authenticating the NHP-Agent identity and device posture

   *  Interfacing with external Authorization Service Providers (ASP) or
      IAM systems

   *  Evaluating access policies based on identity, context, and
      resource attributes

   *  Instructing NHP-AC components to open or close access paths

   *  Managing session state and expiration

   Functionally, the NHP-Server maps to the *Policy Administrator* role
   defined in NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture.

5.1.3.  NHP-AC (Access Controller)

   The NHP-AC is the enforcement component residing logically or
   physically near protected resources.  Its responsibilities include:

   *  Maintaining default-deny firewall rules for all protected
      resources

   *  Receiving NHP-AOP (AC Operations) commands from the NHP-Server

   *  Temporarily opening access paths for authorized NHP-Agents

   *  Automatically reverting to default-deny state when sessions expire

   *  Reporting access logs and status to the NHP-Server

   The NHP-AC corresponds to the *Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)* in
   NIST SP 800-207 terminology.

5.1.4.  Authorization Service Provider (ASP)

   The ASP is an external identity and policy service that the NHP-
   Server queries for authorization decisions.  This may include:

   *  Identity Providers (IdP) such as LDAP, Active Directory, or OIDC
      providers

   *  Policy Decision Points (PDP) implementing ABAC or RBAC policies

   *  Device posture assessment services

   *  Risk scoring engines

5.2.  Component Interactions

   The following diagram illustrates the relationship between NHP
   components:

   +-------------+          +-------------+          +-------------+
   |             |  NHP-KNK |             |  Auth    |             |
   | NHP-Agent   |--------->| NHP-Server  |<-------->|    ASP      |
   |             |<---------|             |  Query   |   (IAM)     |
   +-------------+  NHP-ACK +-------------+          +-------------+
         |                        |
         |                        | NHP-AOP
         |                        v
         |                  +-------------+
         |    NHP-ACC       |             |
         +----------------->|   NHP-AC    |
         |                  |             |
         v                  +-------------+
   +-------------+                |
   |  Protected  |<---------------+
   |  Resource   |   Data Plane
   +-------------+

5.3.  Deployment Models

   NHP components can be deployed in different configurations:

5.3.1.  Standalone Deployment

   For small environments or testing scenarios, the NHP-Server and NHP-
   AC can coexist on the same host.  This configuration simplifies setup
   while maintaining full protocol compliance.

5.3.2.  Clustered Deployment

   In enterprise or cloud environments, multiple NHP-Servers can be
   deployed in a load-balanced cluster.  Each server manages a pool of
   NHP-AC instances distributed across data centers or network segments.
   The NHP-Agent dynamically discovers the nearest NHP-Server through
   DNS or bootstrap configuration.

5.3.3.  Edge AC Deployment

   Edge nodes (e.g., gateways, routers, or micro-segmentation agents)
   can host lightweight NHP-AC components.  These edge ACs enforce fine-
   grained policies close to workloads, improving latency and fault
   isolation.

5.3.4.  Multi-Tenant Deployment

   In service-provider or multi-cloud environments, each tenant can
   operate an independent NHP-Server while sharing an underlying AC
   infrastructure.  The NHP protocol's namespace isolation ensures
   complete tenant separation through identity-scoped keys and per-
   tenant policy databases.

6.  Protocol Workflow

6.1.  Control Plane vs Data Plane

   The *Control Plane* carries cryptographic authentication and
   authorization information among NHP-Agent, NHP-Server, NHP-AC, and
   optional external ASP.  Control plane messages are encrypted using
   Noise Protocol handshakes.

   The *Data Plane* carries application data between the resource
   requester (NHP-Agent host) and the protected resource, but only after
   NHP-AC explicitly authorizes access.

   This strict separation enforces the _authenticate-before-connect_
   principle central to Zero Trust.

6.2.  Workflow Steps

   The complete NHP workflow consists of the following steps:

   1.  *Knock Request:* NHP-Agent sends NHP-KNK message to NHP-Server
       containing encrypted identity claims and access request.

   2.  *Authorization Query:* NHP-Server validates the cryptographic
       envelope and queries ASP for authorization decision.

   3.  *Authorization Response:* ASP returns authorization decision with
       granted permissions and session parameters.

   4.  *Door Opening:* NHP-Server sends NHP-AOP command to NHP-AC
       instructing it to open access for the specific NHP-Agent.

   5.  *AC Confirmation:* NHP-AC enforces the access rule and replies
       with NHP-ART confirming the operation.

   6.  *Agent Notification:* NHP-Server sends NHP-ACK to NHP-Agent with
       access token and connection parameters.

   7.  *Resource Access:* NHP-Agent sends NHP-ACC to NHP-AC and
       establishes data plane connection to protected resource.

   8.  *Session Maintenance:* NHP-Server and NHP-AC maintain session
       state through NHP-KPL keepalive messages.

   9.  *Logging and Audit:* NHP-AC uploads access logs via NHP-LOG
       messages for compliance and auditing.

7.  Cryptographic Framework

   NHP employs the Noise Protocol Framework [NoiseFramework] for all
   cryptographic operations.  This section defines the required
   cryptographic primitives and handshake patterns.

7.1.  Cryptographic Primitives

   Implementations MUST support the following cryptographic primitives:

            +================+===================+===========+
            | Function       | Algorithm         | Reference |
            +================+===================+===========+
            | DH             | Curve25519        | RFC 7748  |
            +----------------+-------------------+-----------+
            | Cipher         | ChaCha20-Poly1305 | RFC 8439  |
            +----------------+-------------------+-----------+
            | Hash           | SHA-256           | RFC 6234  |
            +----------------+-------------------+-----------+
            | Key Derivation | HKDF              | RFC 5869  |
            +----------------+-------------------+-----------+

                                 Table 1

   Implementations MAY additionally support:

               +==========+===================+===========+
               | Function | Algorithm         | Reference |
               +==========+===================+===========+

               +----------+-------------------+-----------+
               | Hash     | BLAKE2s           | RFC 7693  |
               +----------+-------------------+-----------+

                                 Table 2

7.2.  Noise Protocol Handshake Patterns

   NHP supports the following Noise handshake patterns:

7.2.1.  XX Pattern (Default)

   The XX pattern provides full forward secrecy and identity protection
   for both parties.  It is the RECOMMENDED pattern for most
   deployments.

   XX:
     -> e
     <- e, ee, s, es
     -> s, se

7.2.2.  IK Pattern (Performance Optimized)

   The IK pattern is used when the NHP-Agent knows the NHP-Server's
   static public key in advance, reducing round trips.

   IK:
     <- s
     ...
     -> e, es, s, ss
     <- e, ee, se

7.2.3.  K Pattern (One-Way)

   The K pattern is used for one-way initiation where only the initiator
   needs to be authenticated by the responder.

   K:
     <- s
     ...
     -> e, es, ss

7.3.  Key Management

7.3.1.  Static Keys

   Each NHP component maintains a static Curve25519 key pair:

   *  NHP-Agent: Used for client identity and authentication

   *  NHP-Server: Used for server identity and authentication

   *  NHP-AC: Used for secure communication with NHP-Server

   Static public keys MUST be distributed through a secure out-of-band
   mechanism or registered through the NHP-REG message flow.

7.3.2.  Ephemeral Keys

   Ephemeral keys are generated for each session to provide forward
   secrecy.  Implementations MUST use cryptographically secure random
   number generators for ephemeral key generation.

7.3.3.  Key Rotation

   Static keys SHOULD be rotated periodically.  The NHP-REG and NHP-RAK
   messages support key re-registration without service interruption.

8.  Message Format

   All NHP messages share a common header structure followed by an
   encrypted payload.

8.1.  Message Header

   The NHP message header is 32 bytes with the following structure:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

9.  Logging and Auditing

   NHP provides comprehensive logging capabilities to support security
   monitoring, compliance, and forensic analysis.

9.1.  Log Types

   NHP defines the following log categories:

   Access Logs  Record all access attempts, including source identity,
      timestamp, requested resource, and decision outcome.

   Authentication Logs  Record authentication events including key
      exchanges, identity verification, and authentication failures.

   Policy Logs  Record policy evaluation decisions and the factors
      considered.

   System Logs  Record component health, configuration changes, and
      operational events.

9.2.  Log Format

   All NHP logs SHOULD use structured JSON format with the following
   mandatory fields:

   {
     "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
     "log_type": "access",
     "component": "nhp-ac-01",
     "session_id": "abc123...",
     "user_id": "user@example.com",
     "device_id": "device-uuid",
     "source_ip": "192.0.2.1",
     "resource_id": "resource-001",
     "action": "access_granted",
     "details": {}
   }

9.3.  Log Transmission

   NHP-AC components transmit logs to NHP-Server using NHP-LOG messages.
   Implementations MUST:

   *  Encrypt all log transmissions using the established Noise session

   *  Batch logs to reduce network overhead

   *  Implement retry logic for failed transmissions

   *  Store logs locally if transmission fails

9.4.  Compliance Considerations

   NHP logging supports compliance with:

   *  SOC 2 Type II audit requirements

   *  GDPR access logging requirements

   *  HIPAA audit trail requirements

   *  PCI-DSS logging requirements

10.  Integration with SDP

   NHP is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Software-
   Defined Perimeter (SDP) deployments as defined in [CSA.SDP.Spec2.0].

10.1.  Integration Architecture

   In an SDP integration, NHP components map to SDP components as
   follows:

                  +===============+=====================+
                  | NHP Component | SDP Component       |
                  +===============+=====================+
                  | NHP-Agent     | SDP Initiating Host |
                  +---------------+---------------------+
                  | NHP-Server    | SDP Controller      |
                  +---------------+---------------------+
                  | NHP-AC        | SDP Gateway         |
                  +---------------+---------------------+

                                  Table 14

10.2.  Integration Process

   1.  *Discovery:* SDP Controller advertises NHP-Server endpoint to SDP
       Initiating Hosts.

   2.  *Authentication:* SDP Initiating Host uses NHP-KNK to
       authenticate with NHP-Server instead of SPA.

   3.  *Authorization:* NHP-Server queries SDP Controller for policy
       decisions.

   4.  *Enforcement:* NHP-AC opens ports on SDP Gateway based on NHP-AOP
       commands.

10.3.  Benefits of NHP-SDP Integration

   *  *Stronger Cryptography:* NHP's Noise-based key exchange provides
      better forward secrecy than traditional SPA.

   *  *Mutual Authentication:* Both client and server authenticate each
      other.

   *  *Scalability:* NHP's architecture supports enterprise-scale
      deployments.

   *  *Extensibility:* NHP message types support richer interaction
      patterns.

11.  Integration with DNS

   NHP can integrate with DNS infrastructure to provide stealth
   resolution of protected resources.

11.1.  DNS Integration Architecture

   +-------------+     +-------------+     +-------------+
   | NHP-Agent   |---->| NHP-Server  |---->| DNS Server  |
   |             |     |             |     | (Internal)  |
   +-------------+     +-------------+     +-------------+
         |                   |
         v                   v
   +-------------+     +-------------+
   | Public DNS  |     | NHP-AC      |
   | (No Records)|     |             |
   +-------------+     +-------------+

11.2.  Integration Process

   1.  Protected resources have no public DNS records.

   2.  NHP-Agent authenticates with NHP-Server via NHP-KNK.

   3.  NHP-Server returns resource IP addresses in NHP-ACK only after
       successful authentication.

   4.  NHP-Agent can then connect to the resolved addresses.

   This prevents DNS enumeration attacks and keeps resource addresses
   invisible to unauthorized users.

12.  Integration with FIDO

   NHP supports integration with FIDO2/WebAuthn for strong user
   authentication.

12.1.  FIDO Integration Flow

   1.  User initiates NHP-KNK with FIDO assertion

   2.  NHP-Server validates FIDO assertion with FIDO server

   3.  Upon successful FIDO authentication, NHP-Server proceeds with
       access grant

12.2.  Recovery and Fallback

   For FIDO authentication failures, NHP supports fallback to:

   *  One-Time Password (OTP) via NHP-OTP message

   *  SMS/Email verification codes

   *  Recovery codes

13.  Security Considerations

13.1.  Infrastructure Invisibility

   NHP ensures infrastructure invisibility by:

   *  Encrypting all control plane traffic using Noise Protocol

   *  Requiring mutual authentication before any resource visibility

   *  Maintaining default-deny firewall rules on all NHP-AC components

   *  Supporting ephemeral port allocation for data plane connections

13.2.  Replay Attack Prevention

   NHP prevents replay attacks through:

   *  Timestamp validation with configurable tolerance (RECOMMENDED: 60
      seconds)

   *  Unique nonce per message

   *  Session-bound tokens that cannot be reused across sessions

13.3.  Key Security

   Implementations MUST:

   *  Use cryptographically secure random number generators for all key
      generation

   *  Store private keys in secure enclaves or HSMs where available

   *  Implement key rotation policies

   *  Securely erase key material when no longer needed

13.4.  Session Security

   *  Sessions MUST have configurable expiration (RECOMMENDED default: 4
      hours)

   *  Sessions MUST be revocable by NHP-Server

   *  Session tokens MUST be bound to client identity and IP address

13.5.  Denial of Service Mitigation

   NHP provides DoS resistance through:

   *  Cryptographic puzzles for computationally expensive operations

   *  Rate limiting on NHP-Server and NHP-AC

   *  Cookie-based session resumption to avoid repeated handshakes

13.6.  Limitations

   NHP does not protect against:

   *  Compromised endpoints with valid credentials

   *  Insider threats with legitimate access

   *  Attacks on the data plane after access is granted

   *  Social engineering attacks targeting user credentials

14.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to establish a new registry for NHP
   Message Types with the following initial values:

                    +=======+=========+===============+

15.  Reference Implementation

   An open-source reference implementation of NHP is available at:

   https://github.com/OpenNHP/opennhp

   The reference implementation is developed as an open-source
   initiative under the OpenNHP project, fostering community
   collaboration and transparent development to accelerate adoption and
   ensure rigorous peer review of its security mechanisms.

15.1.  Practical Use Case: StealthDNS

   StealthDNS is a Zero Trust DNS client powered by OpenNHP that
   demonstrates practical application of the NHP protocol for DNS-level
   infrastructure hiding.  It is available at:

   https://github.com/OpenNHP/StealthDNS

   StealthDNS implements the NHP-DNS integration described in this
   specification, providing:

   *  *Invisible DNS Resolution:* Protected domains have no public DNS
      records.  Only authenticated clients can resolve hidden service
      addresses.

   *  *NHP-Powered Authentication:* Uses the OpenNHP library to perform
      cryptographic NHP knocking before DNS resolution.

   *  *Transparent Local Resolver:* Runs as a local DNS resolver
      (127.0.0.1:53), requiring no application changes.

   *  *Cross-Platform Support:* Available on Windows, macOS, Linux,
      Android, and iOS.

   The StealthDNS workflow demonstrates the authenticate-before-connect
   principle:

   1.  Application performs DNS lookup for a protected domain.

   2.  StealthDNS checks if the domain is NHP-protected.

   3.  If protected, StealthDNS performs NHP knock with identity and
       device context.

   4.  Upon successful authentication, the NHP Controller returns
       ephemeral address mappings.

   5.  StealthDNS returns valid DNS records only to authorized clients.

   6.  Unauthorized clients receive NXDOMAIN—the service remains
       invisible.

   This enforces *identity before visibility* and *authorization before
   connectivity*, demonstrating real-world application of NHP
   principles.
